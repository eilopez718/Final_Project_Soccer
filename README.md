	2. We selected this topic becuase of our interest in sports, as well as interest in the way advanced statistics have transformed the analysis of sports performance.
	
	3. Our data includes metrics on a host of offensive and defensive categories such as shots, goals scored, xG, % possession, red/yellow cards, corners as well as home and road splits for each team in the Top 5 Leagues going back to the 2010-11 season.

	4. The goal is to predict which statistical categories are the greatest predictors of success in the top 5 domestic leagues.

## Communications:
